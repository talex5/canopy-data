abstract: A dashboard displaying useful data from MirageOS project and its related libraries.
---

MirageOS is continually updating/improving, keeping track of these changes is tricky.

The aim of this project is to create a dashboard that shows data
about: most used libraries, releases, commits since last release,
top contributors, build status (release, current...), dependencies,
etc...

Let me know what else would be useful, tools I can leverage and
what I'm doing wrong!

The repo: [mirage-dashboard](https://github.com/rudenoise/mirage-dashboard).
