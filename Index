We're in Marrakesh at [Priscilla](http://queenofthemedina.com/en/index.html) working on [MirageOS](https://mirage.io).

There is code of this webservice, [canopy](https://github.com/Engil/canopy).
Feel free to add content (by creating a file in [this
repository](https://github.com/hannesm/canopy-data)).

- Please switch of wireless on your phone, then the laptops will get more waves.

- We need to clean the dishes after lunch and dinner ourselves.  Please organise.

- We hang out in the sun and on IRC in `#mirage` (`irc.freenode.net`).
- Water behind the counter, fruits on the counter.  Help yourself.  If there is none, buy some.
- Towels can be rented by Kasia, ask her.
- Use `nuc1 wifi` network, it runs our own dhcp server.
